# API Builder Training

The goal here is to build up from nothing to an application with a complex API, giving a good introduction to the new features of API Builder as you go.

*NOTE:* You _will_ need to update the _conf/default.js_ in the _welcome_ projects. Add your own email address to the validEmails and if desired change the allowedHosts to allow remote access.
